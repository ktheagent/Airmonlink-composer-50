## 1.0.0 — Build 12 — Phase 2 release candidate

### Score, page, system, and staff layout

- Added a hierarchical layout model for page, system, staff, measure, rhythmic segment, and item coordinates.
- Replaced equal-width note placement with rhythmic-segment profiles and duration-aware horizontal spacing.
- Added measure minimum-width calculation for notes, rests, chords, accidentals, lyrics, text, grace/tuplet foundations, and measure attributes.
- Added forced system/page break preservation through `newSystem` and `newPage` measure properties.
- Added dynamic vertical expansion for lyrics, Tonic Sol-fa, text, and other above/below-staff content.
- Added controlled manual staff/system offsets and reset operations.

### Chords and four layers

- Added semantic chord groups using stable chord IDs at one staff/layer/tick/duration.
- Added interval-above and interval-below commands.
- Added member-note insertion, movement, transposition, playback, removal, save/reopen, and undo/redo support.

- Preserved exactly four independent user-facing layers per staff.

### Workspace and panels

- Added the grouped Composition Notepad on the right.
- Added managed Composition Notepad, Inspector, Tonic Sol-fa, Piano Input, Mixer, and playback View-menu controls.
- Inspector and Piano Input remain hidden by default.
- Added collapsible/tabbed right-dock state, bottom piano dock, safe splitter dimensions, compact-screen redocking, and workspace restoration.
- Panel opening changes viewport allocation rather than semantic score coordinates or playback.

### Metadata and anchored text

- Added semantic composition date, source, movement title, dedication, and supporting credits.
- Added right-aligned composer/date header presentation.
- Added staff-, system-, measure-, segment-, page-, header-, footer-, rehearsal-, tempo-, chord-symbol-, and generic anchored text foundations.

### Pickup measures

- Added Create/Configure Pickup Measure.
- Added nominal-versus-actual first-measure duration handling.
- Added validation against existing note/rest endings.
- Added later-event timing shifts, rest recalculation, undo/redo, playback, and MusicXML implicit-measure support.

### MusicXML and MXL

- Added metadata import/export for work/movement title, composer, lyricist, arranger, rights, source, composition date, dedication, and credits.
- Added multi-verse lyrics, syllabic states, elision, melisma/extend, placement, and stable note attachment.
- Added direction words, rehearsal marks, tempo, dynamics, harmony/chord symbols, page setup, manual page/system breaks, multiple staves/voices, tuplets, ties/slurs, pickup measures, and import reporting foundations.
- Added counts and warnings instead of silently discarding all unsupported content.

### Performance

- Preserved cached score timelines, stable event indexes, lazy Tonic Sol-fa/Mixer rendering, delegated score interaction, fast selection/layer refresh, idle autosave, and targeted invalidation from 0.9.1.
- Added layout-cache signatures and batched Phase 2 mutations.

### Shutdown lifecycle

- Replaced the dirty-score `beforeunload` close cancellation with an explicit Electron main/renderer shutdown protocol.
- Added native Save/Discard/Cancel handling.
- Added duplicate-request protection and deterministic cleanup ordering.
- Added playback/audio stop, all-notes-off, MIDI close, autosave cancellation, workspace persistence, owned-dialog closure, file-lock release, bounded waits, structured shutdown logging, and File → Exit.
- The app remains open on Cancel, save failure, cleanup timeout, or unsafe shutdown rather than silently hiding.

### Compatibility and branding

- Preserved `.airscore` schema `airscore-v9` and score format version 9.
- Preserved `com.airmonlink.composer`, official branding, logo, launcher icon, colours, typography, note-entry controls, staff styling, navigation, and dedicated Tonic Sol-fa page.
- No MuseScore source, branding, icons, UI, or assets were copied.

## 0.9.1 — Build 10

## 0.9.0 — Build 9

- Formal Tonic Sol-fa parser, timed rests and continuations, diagnostics, reverse transcription, and optional above/below-staff integration.
